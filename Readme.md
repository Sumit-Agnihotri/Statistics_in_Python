# ⚔️ Statistics in Python: A Journey Through the Nine Realms

## 📖 The Saga Begins

In the frozen lands of Midgard, Kratos and his son Atreus embark on an epic journey through the mystical realms of Statistics. Guided by the wise Mimir, they must master the ancient art of data to unlock the secrets hidden within numbers themselves.

*"The past is not what defines you, Kratos. It is how you calculate what remains."*
